The impotant functionalities are:

- you can create a many short link you want
- the format of a short link is http://psc.fyi/<your name>
- for each short url you have: 
      - statistics http://psc.fyi/<your name>/stats 
      - graphs 
      - visitor world map 
      - PDF export 
      - QRCode 
- if you register on it:
      - nobody can view your statistics
      - view and edit your short url list
